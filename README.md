# StudentPortal
Project with 3 portals: Admin (manage students, document verification, email verification), Student (registration, attendance with face recognition, fees, academic records), Teacher (manage courses, grades, communication).

The project comprises three interlinked portals:
Admin Portal, Student Portal, and Teacher Portal. The Admin Portal enables college administrators to efficiently manage student data, including document verification through pytesseract integration and email verification. The Student Portal serves as a central hub for students, streamlining tasks like course registration, attendance tracking through slot-wise face recognition, fee payments, and accessing academic records. The Teacher Portal provides educators with powerful tools to manage courses, update time slots, submit grades, and communicate transparently with students
